## Node name "LB" is uppercase

In the provided task definition the web nodes 1-3 are all named in lowercase characters, while the load balancer node
is called "LB", i.e. uppercase.  
Why is it the one breaking the schema?

I kept the original name, because breaking conventions without any sort of communication is bad, it is just stumbling to
see.
