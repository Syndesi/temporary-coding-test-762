# Notes

## YML vs YAML

From a technical standpoint there is no relevant difference between the file extensions `.yml` and `.yaml`, as long as a
single one is used within the whole project (consistency).  
However it should be mentioned, that Ansible's own documentation uses `.yaml`.

Within this code example I am using `.yml`, simply because I like it more, and because I am unaware of SENEC's actual
code style and its conventions.
